## Project Descriptio: {.sidebar}

**Task:** Determine the appropriate nightly rate to charge for a home rental on AirBNB using point interpolation. This code interpolated the prices from AirBnbs with similar characteristics to any other location in between.

**Interpolation approach:** Inverse Distance Weighting, using 10 closest units.

**Estate address:** 20 Maynard Pl, Cambridge, MA 02138

**Characteristics**: The rental is an entire home with 3 bedrooms and 3 baths.
