I love to experience new places, new foods and meet new people.   Having lived in Brazil, Japan, Thailand and many years here in the United States I appreciate diverse viewpoints and customs.    Getting helpful insight from friendly locals makes any stay so much richer.

For my day job, I develop multifamily housing.   I am interested in creating living solutions that allow residents to pursue their passions and interests while having a smaller environmental footprint.    To that end, I am involved in a startup that uses architectural robotics to create transformable spaces.

As a father of five, I am a family man.   I appreciate the challenges and joys of travelling with family.    My wife and I took our children down the Silk Road on a 3 week hand carry only trip.   Getting good local advice can be critical to making a stay pleasant and rewarding for every member of the family.

Many startups have moved research and office operations into the Square to take advantage of the relatively low costs and the proximity to MIT. Nearly demolished in the 1950s, the neighborhood was spared and went so far as to experience a sort of renaissance.
